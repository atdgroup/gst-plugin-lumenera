Building
--------

Building on linux is tested using the autogen script. Tested with liblucamapi.so.2.0 on Ubuntu 12.04 64 bit.

One first checkout run autogen.sh

	$ chmod a+x autogen.sh
	$ ./autogen.sh
	
This will use autotools to setup the dev environment, and complete with the line:
"Now type 'make' to compile this module."
You can do that.

	$ make

	$ sudo make install 
will put install the lo file for use with GStreamer, in /usr/local/lib/gstreamer-1.0
To use this in a pipeline you need to tell gstreamer where to find the .lo file.
use:

	$ export GST_PLUGIN_PATH=/usr/local/lib/gstreamer-1.0

See the INSTALL file for advanced setup.

To import into the Eclipse IDE, use "existing code as Makefile project", and the file EclipseSymbolsAndIncludePaths.xml is included here
to import the library locations into the project (Properties -> C/C++ General -> Paths and symbols).

Libraries
---------

Download and install the lucamapi.

Example script to intall the driver:

	chmod +x install_drivers.sh
	./install_drivers.sh

Example script to copy the required library files reuired to build:

	cd lib/x86-64
	sudo cp liblucamapi.so.2.0 /usr/lib
	sudo ln -s /usr/lib/liblucamapi.so.2.0 /usr/lib/liblucamapi.so.2
	sudo ln -s /usr/lib/liblucamapi.so.2.0 /usr/lib/liblucamapi.so

The file src/Makefile.am contains pointers to where with lucamapi includes and libraries are expected to be.
 - Headers: /usr/include
 - Libraries: /usr/lib

Example commands for installing the GStreamer development libraries on Ubuntu 12.04

	sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:gstreamer-developers/ppa
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install -y dpkg-dev devscripts
	sudo apt-get install -y gstreamer1.0*
	sudo apt-get install -y libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev
	echo "export GST_PLUGIN_PATH=/usr/local/lib/gstreamer-1.0" >> ~/.profile
	sudo apt-get install -y build-essential libgtk-3-dev
